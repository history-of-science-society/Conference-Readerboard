Our knowledge of animals in the history of science, furthermore, as developed from this historiography, has been constrained by foci upon specific charismatic animals at work or in motion. In order to enrich our understanding of animals in the history of science, this panel takes movement as its central point of investigation. It examines the relations between various types of movement, from mechanical motion to geographic translocation, and the knowledge of animals' lives, bodies, and excretions. The panel explores a layered concept of animal movement through these questions: How have people tried to understand animals and their physical movements? What kind of scientific knowledge has been produced in relation to animals as they are introduced or re-introduced to various localities? The presenters specifically look into animals as mobilizers of scientific knowledge. Marianna Szczygielska focuses on the movement of elephants into Eastern European circuses and zoos during the colonial period, in order to delve into connections between veterinary science and concepts of zoological species, race, and identity. Shira Shmuely offers a critical analysis of Alfred Russell Wallace's adopted baby orangutan in order to shed light on the malleable boundaries between natural history, hunting, pet-keeping, and experimentation in physiology and anatomy. Sijia Cheng excavates the development of chemistry in late 19th and early 20th century China that emerged from debates over the political control of seabirds and their guano. Tamar Novick examines the 1944 outbreak of African Horse Sickness as the roles of animals as global migrant-laborers began to shift and thus fostered new thoughts about epidemiology and agriculture. Together, these papers offer a critical if not also complementary response to mobility studies from the history of science perspective by investigating how actions connected to the movement, re-rooting, and thus re-contextualizing animals generate new productive tensions among different ways of knowing.</p><p class=""blockquote"">Organized by Lisa Onaga and Tamar Novick</p>",Biology,"Drift 27, Rm. 032",Organized Session,On the Move: Animal Histories Unleashed from the Cabinet of Curiosities,"Elephant Empire beyond the Colonial Frontier, Alfred Wallace’s Baby Orangutan: A Game, a Pet, a Specimen, The “African Horse Sickness” and the Threat of Movement, More Than Just Poop: Guano in Late 19th and Early 20th Century China, Commentary: On the Move: Animal Histories Unleashed from the Cabinet of Curiosities","Dr. Shira Shmuely, Dr. Tamar Novick, Dr. Marianna Szczygielska,  Sijia Cheng,  Lukas Rieppel", Harriet Ritvo,,30,0

It brings together rich empirical histories of the process of selecting, translating, and publishing the sciences by indigenous elites for Indian readers in regional languages. These papers are based on printed materials in Urdu, Bengali and Hindi – three regional languages widely used across the subcontinent and often associated with distinct communities of religion and knowledge, Muslims and Hindus. Together these papers provide dense case-studies of the reception, translation and reconfiguration of scientific knowledge in a multilingual colonial context with pre-existing knowledge communities and longstanding intellectual traditions. The panel engages with an existing geography within the historiography of science in the British empire, which has London and Calcutta as its centers, by situating its inquiries in the cities of Aligarh, Allahabad and Hyderabad, and their attendant cultures of knowledge. These case-studies aim to demonstrate the cultural embeddedness of knowledge production; the interactions between categories of science and religion; and the importance of language and translation to the global circulations of scientific discourse.</p><p class=""blockquote"">Organized by Sarah Qidwai<br />Sponsored by the Forum for the History of Science in Asia </p>",Aspects of Scientific Practice/Organization,"Drift 27, Rm. 032",Organized Session,Science and Its Local Readers in British India,"Translating Science: Sayyid Ahmad Khan’s Scientific Discourse in Print, Printing Science in the Princely Hyderabad: Nawab Fakhruddin Khan Shamsul Umara’s Epistemological Interventions, Vigyan, Scientific Readerships, and the Colonial Lives of Science Popularization in North India, ca. 1915, 'Itibritto' and 'Upokarita': Tracking a Historically Conscious Narration of Chemistry in Nineteenth Century Bengali Periodicals, Commentary: Science and Its Local Readers in British India"," Sarah Qidwai, Dr. Charu Singh, Ms. Sthira Bhattacharya, Mr. MUHAMMED ASHRAF THIRISSERI, Dr. Minakshi Menon",Dr. Minakshi Menon,,30,0
6,Session,Towards a History of Theoretical Biology,6/4/2019,9:00:00,11:45:00,2019-06-04T09:00:00,2019-06-04T11:45:00,"<p>Today, theoretical biology is often described as the branch of biology that employs mathematical and computational tools to model and represent biological processes in quantitatively precise terms. But it wasn't always this way. A hundred years ago, when theoretical biology first emerged as a distinct research program, it had a drastically different-and far more ambitious-agenda: to critically analyze the conceptual foundations of biology in order to resolve longstanding theoretical disputes and bring about the epistemic unification of biological science. Regrettably, the early 'philosophical' period of theoretical biology has been almost completely forgotten and its existence is seldom acknowledged-let alone carefully examined. This is the goal of this session. More specifically, the session explores the origins of theoretical biology and identifies the motivations that lead prominent biologists in the German and English-speaking worlds to take up the cause of theoretical biology in the early twentieth century. It explores the efforts to create an international community of theoretical biologists and to institutionalize the discipline by means of book series, specialized journals, and conferences. The session also recounts the attempts to revive the old, 'philosophical' form of theoretical biology in the 1960s, and why these ultimately failed. Speakers in this session share the conviction that only by adopting a broader conception of what it means to 'do theory' in biology-one that is respectful of theoretical biology's own history and which brings together formal and non-formal approaches-can the field recover its former relevance to the rest of biology.</p><p class=""blockquote"">Organized by Jan Baedke and Daniel J.

They show how binaries – including feminine and masculine, male and female, active and passive, emotional and rational – imbue scientific practice with local meanings. And they show how gendered commitments shape global concepts like nature, body, and mind. Our panel adds development to this list. Relying upon various insights from feminist STS, each panelist will think through case studies in the history of medicine and the human sciences. Collectively, we explore the cross-cultural ways that gender organizes the scientific study of developmental processes. We foreground a transnational network of scientists who studied how cultures, bodies, and identities changed over time. Barbara Pohl begins in early twentieth century, examining how feminist anthropologists used ""gender-critical"" methods to understand cultural development in the American southwest. Lan A. Li moves to the mid-twentieth century, recounting how acupuncture analgesia disrupted developmental assumptions about the human body in greater China, Germany, and the United States. Susanne Schmidt lands in the late twentieth century, exploring the anti-feminist commitments of Euro-American developmental psychologists and psychoanalysts. Soha Bayoumi ends in contemporary Egypt, considering how ""popular"" sexologists have approached questions of modern femininity. Eli Nelson will provide a synthetic commentary, bringing insights from postcolonial and queer feminist STS to our discussion.

This panel examines how images and knowledge circulated between painters, draughtsmen, printmakers, naturalists and scientific practitioners. Our chronological focus spans from 1500 to 1800, from the German artist Albrecht Dürer's musings on the limits of mathematizing the art of perspective to the visual accounts of James Cook's voyages to the Pacific. We interpret the development of early modern science in a global context, and investigate how European, Latin American and Asian practitioners interacted with each other, exchanging and producing textual and visual information in the process. We also critically examine the limitations of such an approach, paying a special attention to what factors hindered or completely blocked the circulation in the period, both across the globe and across different professional backgrounds. This panel is highly diverse, incl. speakers and commentators from the USA, the United Kingdom, Spain and Hungary, from four different institutions.

10,Session,What a Life Means: The Uses of Biography in the History of Science,6/4/2019,9:00:00,11:45:00,2019-06-04T09:00:00,2019-06-04T11:45:00,"<p>Biography appeals to historians of science again, but perhaps not in a form that most biographers would recognize. There are now biographies of animals, of inanimate objects and of concepts, of institutions, of landscapes. This flourishing of biographies in recent decades can be seen as our discipline's reinvention of a genre that has been critiqued as naively theory-resistant, conservative, and useful at best as a pretext for contextualisation of scientific work. But this reinvention demands methodological reflection: does biography survive only as metaphorical shorthand, or does it serve historiographical purposes of its own? This panel offers four perspectives on the historiographical functions of the genre, both in its new incarnations and in its more traditional form of the story of a life told by someone else. Joan Richards and Daniela Helbig foreground biography's potential for understanding science as part of the meaning of a lived life, as long argued for by our commentator Ted Porter. In contrast, Roberto Lalli and Lily Huang investigate the historiographical implications of studying other entities in biographical terms: institutions and metaphors. Our shared aim is to examine the different functions of biography as an analytic lens, and to question when and why the framing of a narrative as a life can produce a distinctive historical insight.</p><p class=""blockquote"">Organized by Daniela Helbig</p>",Tools for Historians of Science,"Drift 13, Rm. 004",Organized Session,What a Life Means: The Uses of Biography in the History of Science,"The Known and the Lived: Melitta Schiller-Stauffenberg , On Ways of Dying: Biographies of Metaphors and the History of Science, Institutional Lives: Biography as Analytical Tool for a Unified Narrative of International Scientific Organizations, Of Ideas and Ideals: Biography as Analytic Tool, Commentary: What a Life Means: The Uses of Biography in the History of Science","Dr. Daniela Helbig,  Roberto Lalli, Prof. Theodore Porter,  Joan  Richards,  Lily Huang",Prof. Theodore Porter,,235,0

They have proposed variants such as ""Mode 2 science"" and ""post-normal science,"" which would draw policy-makers and concerned citizens into the process of designing and evaluating research. Their stated aim is to democratize the knowledge-making process and orient it more firmly towards users' needs. More recently, scientists themselves have begun to echo these recommendations. They emphasize the value of public engagement for a variety of purposes, from gaining legitimacy for their research, to mining big data, to ensuring that their conclusions will be taken up by policy-makers. This reorientation is evident, for instance, in recent initiatives arrayed under the banner of ""citizen science,"" such as the Cornell bird count or Galaxy Zoo. But how novel are these modes of scientific research? Assessing the degree to which these initiatives depart from ""normal science"" requires historical and epistemological analysis. Accordingly, participants in this session will analyze past experiments in participatory research in a range of sciences (seismology, climatology, astronomy, biomedicine, and scientific agriculture) and in various transnational historical contexts (from the Progressive Era to the post-Cold War), in order to generate critical historical perspectives on contemporary modes of participatory research.

This session brings together scholars conducting new research on twentieth-century entomology in multiple places, many of them settler societies: provincial China, U.S.S.R., Malaysia, Kenya and Argentina. These studies reveal how insect population management was entangled with new visions of anthropogenic 'natural' and agricultural landscapes, pastoral indigenous peoples' perceptions and activities, and the development of global networks of like-minded entomologists. Alejandro Martinez analyzes perceptions of 'natural' insect control as part of creating 'balanced' ecological landscapes in early-20th century Argentina. Yubin Shen explores the multi-national network of entomologists (mostly U.S.-China) that created the Jiangsu Provincial Bureau of Entomology in the 1920s. Sabine Clark tells the story of cautiously-applied locust control measures in Kenya after 1945, highlighting Kenyan herdsmen's concerns about their cattle being poisoned. Marin Coudreau analyzes the entanglement of insect management regimes with militarized forced migrations and state management of the agricultural peasantry in the late Russian empire-early Soviet Union. Aaron Van Neste details an entomologist's importation of the African palm weevil from Cameroon to Malaysia as a palm-tree pollinator in the 1970s-80s, and the novel multi-species ecologies and labor histories that were generated as a result.

However, sometimes things go wrong-nature incidentally makes mistakes. Can natural errors (like ""monsters"") be amended? This panel addresses the tensions between regularity and exceptions, description and manipulation of nature in premodern times. How did premodern thinkers justify the exceptions to the regularity of nature? What were the conditions for their assumption that an exception to that regularity was ""unnatural""? How did they think they could achieve a manipulation of nature? By ""manipulation"" we mean the propelling of natural regulated changes towards a preconceived goal. Which presuppositions enabled them to consider the possibility of such manipulation? What was the metaphysical, epistemological, and theological frame that supported this kind of thinking? Nicholas Aubin explores the relation between nature, art, and medicine in the Muslim tradition as expressed in al-??mir?'s thought. Marienza Benedetto addresses the birth of monsters in the Jewish tradition, as found in Maimonides medical works. Nicola Polloni examines patterns of regularity and irregularity of nature in Hermann of Carinthia of the Latin-Neoplatonist tradition.

To date, the phones of 91 million persons around the globe have already buzzed with these words – the opening salvos of courtship in the world of online dating. Yet what, precisely, is a ""match""? Behind the multi-billion-dollar dating industry stand programmers and statisticians seeking to bring, in the words of OkCupid's Christian Rudder, ""mathematically-minded … analysis and rigor to what had historically been the domain of love 'experts' and grinning warlocks like Dr. Phil."" Far from a hot-headed discourse of the passions, the ""match"" is about cool-headed engineering: the concepts and practices for sorting personal information and targeting individuals from among larger populations. The history of the ""match"" is a history of knowledge. Elena Serrano examines how early-eighteenth-century theories of the female body taught men to distinguish, from outward traits and gestures, between ""physical"" and ""moral"" love.

This panel explores these dimensions of Portugal's empire and their consequences for medicine and natural history at the height of European colonialism. The focus on disparate scientific protagonists, chronologies, and colonial spaces, allows each paper to explore how natural knowledge came to be perceived as a solution to the difficult problem of colonial government at a time of fierce inter-imperial competition – from the 1750's to the early twentieth century. If it was unquestionable to naturalists, physicians, as well as to both colonial and metropolitan administrators that the effective government of empire entailed reaping the formidable natural fecundity of Portuguese colonies, this goal remained enduringly elusive. Through an examination of visual and material culture, natural and anthropological collections, labor regimes and power structures, this panel reflects on the importance of natural landscape, built space, travel, and material circulations for the production of knowledge. Rather than choosing between object-centered or human-centered histories, we consider the crucial role of both subjects and objects to knowledge making in the context of Portugal's imperial desiderata.

This year’s plenary session explores what it currently means to be an engaged historian of science with an eye toward inviting further conversation with our audience and within the history of science community more broadly. The session will feature a small number of young colleagues whose research and related activities exemplify creative forms of engagement both within and beyond our discipline. This will be followed by a presentation by Sheila Jasanoff, in which she draws on her broad and deep expertise to reflect on how engaged scholarship deepens our understanding of the roles of science in society and of society in science.We are grateful to be able to commence the HSS 2019 Meeting in The Janserk--an icon of Utrecht. </p> <p>The Janskerk was built in the middle of the 11th century as a collegiate church. The client was bishop Bernold, who was also the founder of the Utrecht Pieterskerk. It is therefore not surprising that the two churches originally looked very similar. Just like the Pieterskerk, the Janskerk became a Romanesque columned basilica, built from tuff and equipped with chapels, two towers and the round arch windows characteristic of Romanesque architecture. In both churches the nave was equipped with large pink-red columns, each made from one piece of sandstone, and in both churches there was a crypt.</p> <p>In contrast to that of the Pieterskerk, which is still accessible, that of the Janskerk was closed at the end of the 13th century. Another important change was the conversion of the columns to pillars. The columns were not strong enough to support the weight of the church and therefore they were reinforced. One of the pillars has now been partially opened, so that the original pink-red column is visible again. A column is also arranged in its entirety in the left-hand side aisle. In contrast to the nave and the side aisles, where the wallwork is mostly 11th century, the choir and the chapels have undergone a major change since the construction period. They were rebuilt in the Gothic style in the period 1508-1539.</p> <p>In a nutshell: the use of the church then and now. From its construction in the 11th century until 1580, the Janskerk served for centuries as a Catholic collegiate church. After the city authorities had banned Catholicism, the church was used as a reformed church and it was given other functions. For example, a library was established in the choir in 1584 and in 1813, during the last year of the French occupation, the church was briefly used as a barrack.</p> <p>Since 1947 a student pastor came to the Janskerk. This resulted in the Evangelical University Municipality (EUG), nowadays called the EUG Ecumenical Student Municipality. In addition to the weekly service on Sundays, the Janskerk is rented out for all kinds of different events, such as concerts, congresses and weddings.</p> <p> </p> <p class=""blockquote"">Organized by Lissa Roberts</p> <hr /> <p><iframe src=""https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d2451.256471997926!2d5.119287815956054!3d52.09326377551815!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x47c66f450b042781%3A0xd96888f4e0f808e7!2sJanskerk!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1555604996466!5m2!1sen!2sus"" width=""100%"" height=""300"" style=""border: 0;"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p>",Tools for Historians of Science,"Janskerk, Janskerkhof 26",Special Event,,,"Dr. Edna Bonhomme,  Sheila Jasanoff,  Benjamin Franta, Dr. Joppe van Driel",Prof. Lissa Roberts,,0,0
